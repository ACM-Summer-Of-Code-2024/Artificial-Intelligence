    "#### Introduction:\n",
    "Clustering is a technique used to group similar objects based on inherent characteristics. The goal is to partition points into clusters where points in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. This technique is valuable for extracting insights from data and has applications in various fields such as customer segmentation, document categorization, and image classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Definition:\n",
    "- The objective is to analyze a set of images using clustering algorithms. The data, provided in the form of images and associated CSV files, must be grouped into clusters based on similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Steps:**\n",
    "  1. Preprocess the images and extract features using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) like VGG16.\n",
    "  2. Implement clustering algorithms (K-Means and DBSCAN) on the feature vectors to group the images into clusters.\n",
    "  3. Evaluate and compare the performance of the clustering methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Extraction and Processing:\n",
    "- **Step 1:** Use the VGG16 model (excluding the fully connected layers) to extract features from the images.\n",
    "- **Step 2:** Perform image preprocessing and prepare the data for clustering.\n",
    "- **Step 3:** Discuss the importance of feature extraction and why reading raw pixels is insufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clustering Implementation:\n",
    "- **Step 4:** Apply the K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms to the feature vectors and determine the optimal parameters (e.g., number of clusters `K` in K-Means).\n",
    "- **Step 5:** Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of K-Means and DBSCAN for the given data.\n",
    "- **Step 6:** Compare the clustering results and assess the effectiveness of each method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dimensionality Reduction:\n",
    "- **Step 7:** Reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to visualize the clusters in 2D/3D space.\n",
    "- **Step 8:** Discuss the PCA process and how it helps in reducing the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis and Evaluation:\n",
    "- **Step 9:** Evaluate the clustering results using metrics such as silhouette score and homogeneity score.\n",
    "- **Step 10:** Provide recommendations for improving the clustering models and suggest further steps for analysis.\n",
