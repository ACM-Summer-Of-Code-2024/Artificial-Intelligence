        "In this assignment, you will explore various loss functions and apply gradient descent methods to optimize these functions. The focus will be on the Diabetes dataset from the scikit-learn library, a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. This dataset consists of medical diagnostic measurements from numerous patients and is specifically designed to study diabetes progression. You will use these data points to predict the quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline, allowing you to practice regression analysis in a medical context.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Important Notes\n",
        "\n",
        "For this assignment, you are required to implement the functions in \"Part 1: Functions’ Implementation\" from scratch. The use of pre-built libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, or similar for these specific tasks is prohibited.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dataset Description\n",
        "\n",
        "The diabetes dataset consists of 442 instances with the following ten baseline variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Age**: Age in years\n",
        "2. **Sex**: Gender of the patient\n",
        "3. **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: A measure of body fat based on height and weight\n",
        "4. **Average Blood Pressure (BP)**: Mean blood pressure value\n",
        "5. **Six blood serum measurements**:\n",
        "   - **s1**: Total serum cholesterol (tc)\n",
        "   - **s2**: Low-density lipoproteins (ldl)\n",
        "   - **s3**: High-density lipoproteins (hdl)\n",
        "   - **s4**: Total cholesterol / HDL ratio (tch)\n",
        "   - **s5**: Possibly the logarithm of serum triglycerides level (ltg)\n",

        "2. **Display the First Ten Rows**: This will help you understand the structure and values of the dataset.\n",
        "3. **Check Data Types**: Print the data types of each feature to ensure they are numeric, which is necessary for regression analysis.\n",
        "4. **Handle Missing Values**: Check for any missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately if any exist.\n",
        "5. **Normalize the Features**: Normalize the features to ensure all are on a similar scale, which helps in improving the performance of the regression model.\n",
        "6. **Split the Data**: Split the data into training and testing sets using a standard ratio (e.g., 95% training, 5% testing). Use sklearn's `train_test_split` function or an equivalent method ensuring a random split.\n",
        "7. **Confirm the Split**: Display the number of instances in both the training and testing datasets to confirm the split.\n",
